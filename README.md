# COP4331-Large-Project
Summer 2024 Junior Design Full-Stack app


This is your team's large project, Please note that all members must submit the PowerPoint presentation BEFORE their presentation. Your due date will be the same as your presentation date.

You have 15 minutes. Make sure your team practices the presentation. <-- Make sure!

Your team's list and presentation time can be found at the google sheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ykiAYu9BqM8L5LmX5ewNV8LpApr3zX7JAIcb9-mX2-g/edit#gid=0 Links to an external site..  You will need a project title and your github link. The presentation time will be assigned later

The large project presentations will be 15 minutes. Attendance for all presentations is mandatory. Immediately in advance of your presentation you DO NOT have time to go the google drive, drop box, or the like and retrieve your material. You should have your slides and support material on a USB stick. All members must participate in the presentation and be present.

You may not show the webapp from a local instance--it must be on a remote server. You are not allowed to use a mobile emulator. You MUST use a web cam and show a physical phone,.

You are also required to use a remote hosting service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, GoDaddy, AWS, or Azure. I will be demonstrating the MERN stack using Heroku. You must access your app with a domain name rather than an IP address.

The slides must be professional and start with a title page followed by a members page. Then you should explain what the project is, how it was developed, and anything that you feel is important. Gantt chart, UML SwaggerHub, email verification, and/or ER diagrams are required. Talk about what went well and what did not go well. Leave time for questions and have a questions page.

# Project Requirements:
Remote database
Use a MERN stack. (Can also use Vue or Angular, or Firebase)
Use JSON to communicate between client and server. During the presentation, you must show access to at least one API endpoint using SwaggerHub.
You will use a web page as the client. (A web page must be AJAX enabled that accesses the API.)
A mobile application

The program is a project of your choice. .

The user interface should be clean and professional. The project should be as professional as possible. The source and support files must be in github (You will add the link to the sign up sheet).

# Deliverables:
Unzipped PowerPoint presentation -- (all members must submit before the presentation) 
First, make sure you put your github link into the spreadsheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ykiAYu9BqM8L5LmX5ewNV8LpApr3zX7JAIcb9-mX2-g/edit#gid=0 . 
You will get a zero if you miss your team's presentation without prior approval of the instructor.
